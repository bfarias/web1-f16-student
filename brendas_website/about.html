	 <div class="body">
			<p>I took this class because I'm interested in exploring UI/UX design. I explored coding in high school and felt drawn to it ever since. I think there is so much to explore and there are so many possibilities. Therefore, I hope to be able to code and design websites that stand out from the norm. Most websites have a general rule of thumb or a common structure, but wouldn't it be nice to create a unique experience for the user? I want to make people feel special and intrigued when they see my work. I have a great understanding of HTML and CSS, so I am really eager to learn more about the back-end developemnt languages such as javascript, php, and python. I think learning back-end development is key to my goals.
