	<h1>Brenda's Portfolio Process</h1>
	<h2>Needs</h2>
	<p>I am a graphic designer who needs a website to display my work. My portfolio needs to look simple and modern to show that I am sophisticated and easy to talk to. I don’t want to confuse my audience with fancy effects and designs. There needs to be a page dedicated to my biography, a page dedicated to my work, a page dedicated to my contact information, and a page dedicated to a public journal, or blog.
My work page should have categories that include print design, web design, and illustrations. I think it’s important to keep my work organized this way so that people can see that I am flexible with my work. I would like my journal page to be a place where I can show what I’m currently working on or what I’ve been interested in exploring. This will help me get up close and personal with my audience without actually contacting them. My about me page will have a biography, but also a FAQ section.
The style of my portfolio will explore monochromatic color schemes. I’m not picky about a precise color. Whatever looks best on the screen is fine for me. I definitely want a picture of myself made to be grayscale or duotoned with the website colorscheme.</p>

	<h2>Inspiration</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.Danvlahos.com"> Dan Vlaho's Website</a></li>
		<p>I really liked the idea of creating an interactive image to navigate the projects he has worked on. The blue highlight makes it easier to see what your about to click. It's like a game.</p>
		<li><a href="http://www.josephquackenbush.com"> Joe Quackenbush's Website</a></li>
		<p>I enjoy that there is not a fancy logo, it's just his name. The buttons are highlighted when your on that specific button's page. There is an easy grid structure to navigate as well. But I feel like this grid is overused by many artists.</p>
		<li><a href="http://www.andyhau.com/portfolio/"> Andy's Website</a></li>
		<p>I love that the logo is transparent, so you notice it changes when you're scrolling through the page. The hovering arrows on the portfolio page add liveliness to the website. I found it clever that there was a buy symbol on designs that are purchasable.</p>
		<li><a href="https://niceandserious.com/work"> Nice and Serious' Website</a></li>
		<p>I love that the page opens with a very brief animation. It's short and sweet so it doesn't feel annoying. They have filters on their work page to make it easier for the audience to find a specific project.</p>
