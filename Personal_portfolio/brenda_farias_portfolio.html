	<h1>Brenda's Portfolio Process</h1>
	<h2>Needs</h2>
	<p>I am a graphic designer who needs a website to display my work. My portfolio needs to look simple and modern to show that I am sophisticated and easy to talk to. I don’t want to confuse my audience with fancy effects and designs. There needs to be a page dedicated to my biography, a page dedicated to my work, a page dedicated to my contact information, and a page dedicated to a public journal, or blog.
My work page should have categories that include print design, web design, and illustrations. I think it’s important to keep my work organized this way so that people can see that I am flexible with my work. I would like my journal page to be a place where I can show what I’m currently working on or what I’ve been interested in exploring. This will help me get up close and personal with my audience without actually contacting them. My about me page will have a biography, but also a FAQ section.
The style of my portfolio will explore monochromatic color schemes. I’m not picky about a precise color. Whatever looks best on the screen is fine for me. I definitely want a picture of myself made to be grayscale or duotoned with the website colorscheme.</p>
