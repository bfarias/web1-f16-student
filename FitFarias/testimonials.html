						<h2>Cecilia's Testimonial</h2>
						<p>
						“I started training with Ashley to lose some of the stubborn fat around my middle and generally tone up. Using barbells and various bodyweight exercises, my overall strength and fitness improved so much in a short space of time that I was able to perform exercises I would never have attempted on my own. I have learnt so much from Ashley, she is willing to share her expert knowledge and answer any questions you come up with. Her tips on nutrition are excellent and her dedication is clear. Ashley is energetic, fun, committed and inspirational…and I can’t recommend her enough!” - Cecilia

						<h2>Brenda's Testimonial</h2>
						<p>
						“When I approached Ashley, I had just finished bulking up and gaining strength through my own powerlifting workouts, but I definitely gained excess fat in my ambitions to gain muscle. I was eager to see how my body would look wth this new muscle but without the extra fat. Ashley helped me shed the fat without compromising the strength and muscles I gained. Not only do I look slimmer, but I feel better, stronger, and healthier. Ashley was able to do more than help me shed fat. She helped me fix my imbalances and taught me proper techniques to avoid injuries. I wouldn't feel as good as I do now without her help.” - Brenda
