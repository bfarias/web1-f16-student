		<h2>Welcome! Let Me Help You.</h2>
		<p>I commit myself to my clients and team members 100% – always giving my best. I expect them to not only commit 100% to me, but also to themselves, to be the best and most healthy person they can be.
			<br><br>
			 I am committed to empowering others’ health through fitness, nutrition, and lifestyle choices. Empowerment is more than helping someone. It is giving them the power and confidence to make healthy
		choices on their own. I teach others awareness so they can live a life free to choose health and energy, rather than being trapped in the vicious cycle that keeps them overweight and depressed. I give people the freedom of choice to live their lives to the full.
		<br><br>
		My purpose has become to not only help people lose fat or gain muscle but to also help people maintain a healthy lifestyle that doesn’t interfere with their life at work, home, or with friends. More often than not people are told to go to the extremes to achieve their goals but I’m hereto prove that fitness can be enjoyable. Fitness is something you CAN achieve.</p>
