    Gabriel Picolo is a 22 year-old male artist who was born and raised in Sao Paulo, Brazil. You may know his drawings from the 365 days of doodles,
    a project he took in 2014 where hr drew one drawing a day for the whole year. For his drawings he takes inspiration from Studio Ghibli, Disney,
    video games among other stuff.  He loves to draw something that is relatable to him and other people as well. It may be a complex doodle about feelings or an
    eye candy fan art but what he loves the most is the connection he creates with who's seeing his work.
