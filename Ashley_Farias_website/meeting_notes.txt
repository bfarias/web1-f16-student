Client Meeting
- I would like my website to promote myself as a personal trainer, and I would like to promote my services. 
	-there needs to be a page where people can learn about me, rather than 	surf the web to figure out who I am.
- It needs to be viewable on all devices
- My business provides programs to help people lose fat, to maintain their weight, to gain weight, and to gain muscle.
	-I want their to be a focus on helping people reach their fitness goals at a fast and healthy pace.
	-I offer 1 on 1 coaching, nutritional advice and guidance, moral support, and motivation.
- The site needs to have:
	-navigation menu
	-social media buttons
	-testimonials
	-list of services offered
	-about me
- Some websites I enjoy are Fusaro Fitness, Barbell Brigade, Layne Norton, Juggernaut Strength, FitNika 101, ChelseaLifts' RTB
- Would like to have motion graphics applied to her logo.
