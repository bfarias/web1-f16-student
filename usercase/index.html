	<h1>Brenda Farias' User Case Scenario Page</h1>
	 <h2>Use Case: Find the about location button.</h2>
			<p>I was able to find the button but i couldn't find a way to use the tab key to select the body text. I couldn't get my reader to tell me where the location was because it skipped the paragraph. I don't know how to fix this</p>
		<h2>Fixed</h2>
			<p>I had a corrupt code in the file and deleted it.</p>

			<h2>Use Cases:</h2>
				<p>1.Navigate to the list of artists performing<br>
				2.Find the prices and price options for different days and parking.<br>
				3.Discover what the event is about<br>
