				I really enjoy listening and/or watching youtube videos while I work
				on school projects, personal projects, or errands. </p></li>
			<li><a href="www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a><p>
				This is a great website/app that I like to scroll through for inspiration.
				I also like to use this as a public diary/blog.

			<li><a href="www.behance.net">Behance</a><p>
				Honestly, I only use this because MassArt told me to but I somehow became addicted to it.
				I stalk graphic designers on ehre all the time.

			<li><a href="www.pinterest.com">Pinterest</a><p>
				Another great website to organize my obsessive interests. I would be a hoarder if
				it weren't for pinterest.

				Do I really need to explain this? Instagram is a necessity. Just use it. for you're own sake.
