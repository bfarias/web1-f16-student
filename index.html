			<p> I really love simple and minimal web design. Seeing less on the screen allows me to save time because it's easier to find what I'm looking for.
				Society 6 is super clean and easy to use. I love their use of whitespace.

				This is a great website/app that I like to scroll through for inspiration.
				The user interface is so simple and friendly. I absolutely love the phone application as well,
				due to it's convient layout.
			</p></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.behance.net/">Behance</a><p>
				Honestly, I only use this because MassArt told me to but I somehow became addicted to it.
				The website feels like a showcase, and it's easy to find what you're looking for.

				Another great website design in my opinion. Most gaming sites have to many graphics which make it harder
				to load the page and focus on what you're looking for. This site is simple but extravagant. I love that the background
				moves as you scroll through the page. The falling snowflakes are a nice touch to the clean, simple interface.

			<li><a href="http://www.chipotle.com/">Instagram</a><p>
				Chipotle's website is one of my favorites. Other than their great burritos, I love their playful and enthusiastic website.
				It's very welcome and easy to use. I like the use of symmetry and white spacce.
